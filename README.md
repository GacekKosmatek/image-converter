# Image converter

## Converts files like jpg, png, gif (in the works) into terminal output

## Why?
- I wanted to learn rust so I've made this to get a basic understanding of the language
- It seemed like a fun project
- I wanted to play gifs or videos in the terminal

## Requirements
- Rust (I am on version `v1.63.0-nightly` and it worked fine, I'm not sure if its gonna work on other versions)

## How to build
- Clone the repository
- Run `cargo build --release` to get all the optimizations
- The executable should be in the `target/release` folder

## Example
